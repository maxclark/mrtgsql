	mrtgsql - a MRTG to SQL logging and reporting tool for MRTG
	by Max Clark <max@clarksys.com>
	-----------------------------------------------------------

mrtgsql is composed of two programs: mrtgsql which inserts data from the 
MRTG .log files into a database, and mrtgreport which reports usage on the 
interfaces in total GB and the 95th percentile.

Required Modules
----------------

- DBI and DBD::Pg or DBD::MySQL
  -> get it from CPAN

Note that several Linux distributions will already have these modules as 
RPMs.


Usage
-----

mrtgsql is made of two scripts:

- mrtgsql

  This script parses the MRTG .log files and updates the database with the 
  values.
 
  usage: mrtgreport [*options*]
  -h, --help           display this help and exit
      --version        output version information and exit
  -v, --verbose        be verbose
  -d, --directory      directory where the mrtg .log files exist
      --dbname         database name to connect to
      --dbuser         database user name
      --dbpass         database password

  If -d is not specified, it defaults to /usr/local/mrtg. Directory, 
  dbname, dbuser, and dbpass are configurable within the script.

- mrtgreport

  This script reports data from the database in Total GB and the 95th 
  percentile.

  usage: mrtgreport [*options*]
  -h, --help           display this help and exit
      --version        output version information and exit
  -v, --verbose        display debug messages
  -l, --lastmonth      report for the previous month
  -y, --year           select the year in YYYY format, defaults to the
                       current year
  -m, --month          select the month in MM format, defaults to the
                       current month
      --dbname         database name to connect to
      --dbuser         database user name
      --dbpass         database password

  If a date is not specified the script defaults to the current month. For 
  reporting purposes you should run this script with -l for the previous 
  month.
